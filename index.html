    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whale parvorder Mysticeti.
        Reaching a maximum confirmed length of 29.9 metres (98 ft) and weighing up to 199 tonnes (196 long tons; 219
        short tons), it is the largest animal known to have existed. The blue whale's long and slender body can be
        various shades of greyish-blue dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath.

        The Society for Marine Mammalogy's Committee on Taxonomy currently recognizes four subspecies: B. m. musculus in
        the North Atlantic and North Pacific, B. m. intermedia in the Southern Ocean, B. m. brevicauda (the pygmy blue
        whale) in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean, B. m. indica in the Northern Indian Ocean. There is also a
        population in the waters off Chile that may constitute a fifth subspecies.

        Blue whales are filter feeders and their diet consists almost exclusively of euphausiids (krill). They are
        generally solitary or gather in small groups and have no well-defined social structure other than mother-calf
        bonds. The fundamental frequency for blue whale vocalizations ranges from 8 to 25 Hz and the production of
        vocalizations may vary by region, season, behavior, and time of day.

        The blue whale was once abundant in nearly all the Earth's oceans until the end of the 19th century. It was
        hunted almost to the point of extinction by whalers until the International Whaling Commission banned all blue
        whale hunting in 1966. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed blue whales as endangered
        as of 2018. <br>
        It continues to face numerous threats, both man-made (ship strikes, pollution, ocean noise and
        climate change), and natural (killer whale predation).
