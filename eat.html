                Blue whales, being the size they are, need a lot of food to give them the energy they need to survive
                and to build their thick blubber layers to keep them warm in the ocean’s cold waters. Ironically, the
                largest animal on the planet survives by eating one of the smallest. Feasting mostly on krill – a tiny
                shrimp like creature found in great clouds in the ocean – <br>
                blue whales can eat as many as 40 million a
                day. <br>
                Scooping them up in huge mouthfuls of water, they filter out the krill from the seawater through
                curtain-like teeth known as baleen, releasing the water back into the sea.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p> Although their gulping
                feeding strategy doesn’t allow them to be picky. Sometimes fish, copepods, and other small animals will
                get caught up in the mix and be eaten by the whales. When food is plentiful, blue whales can eat between
                four and eight tons of krill per day, or upwards of 40 million individual krill. Thankfully, their
                throats expand to accommodate all that food! Due to their size, blue whales are not often preyed upon,
                though pods of marine mammal eating orca whales will sometimes attack and share younger blue whales.

        Krill are zooplankton invertebrates that float in huge swarms in oceans all over the world. These swarms
        sometimes reaching densities they can turn the surface of the ocean pinkish-red.
    </p>

    <p>
        The lowly krill averages only about two inches in length, but it represents a giant-sized link in the global
        food chain. These small, shrimp-like crustaceans are essentially the fuel that runs the engine of the Earth’s
        marine ecosystems.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since krill tend to gather in the open ocean, you can generally expect to find blue whales farther from the
        coasts and in waters deeper than 650 feet in search of them

    <h3><b>
            How many different species of krill are there?
        </b></h3>

    <p>
        There are 85 known species of krill. Krill is comprised of two families the largest of which is
        Euphausiidae which contains 20 different genra, the largest of which is the Euphausia. The other family
        of Krill is the Bentheuphausia ampblyops, which lives in the deep waters <br>
        (below 3,330 feet) and are the
        most primitive species of krill.
    </p>

    <p>
        Euphausia superba krill are the most common krill, found mostly in the waters of the Antarctic.
        Euphausia krill are at the very bottom of the food chain and can only found in the pristine oceans
        around Antarctcia, where there is very limited accumulation of contaminants.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most well known species of the Euphausiidae are the Antarctic Krill (Euphausia superba), Pacific
        krill (Euphausia pacifica) and Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica).

        alt="Swarm of Krill">
    <p>
        Antarctic krill are one of the most abundant animal species, there are about 500 million tons of krill in
        the Southern Ocean.

        Krill travel in swarms primarily as a defense mechanism to confuse predators that would pick out single
        krill. In additional efforts to avoid predators, krill are found to spend their day at greater depths in the
        ocean and rise during the night toward the surface. It has also been found that the deeper they go in the
        water, the more their activity lessens, to reduce the probability of encounters with predators as well as
        conserve their energy.

        alt="Lifespan of Krill diagram">
    <p>
        The lifespan of a krill is typically up to 10 years, six years on average which is not bad for a heavily sought
        after creature.
    </p>
    <p>
        Life Cycle: The main spawning season of Antarctic Krill is from January to March, above the continental shelf.
        Female krill lay up to 10,000 eggs at a time, sometimes several times a season.
    </p>
    <p>
        The eggs are spawned close to the surface and start sinking. In the open ocean they sink for about 10 days: the
        nauplii hatch at around 3000 m depth.

    <h3><b>Role In The Food Chain</b></h3>
    <img src="https://www.greenpeace.org.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-13-at-10.49.25-AM.png"
        alt="Role in the Food Chain Diagram">
    <p>
        Krill feed on phytoplankton, microscopic, single-celled plants that drift near the ocean’s surface and live off
        carbon dioxide and the sun’s rays. They in turn are the main staple in the diets of literally hundreds of
        different animals, from fish, to birds, to baleen whales.

        Simply put, many oceanic life forms depend on krill.

    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3><b>Importance to the Antarctic Ecosystem</b></h3>
    <p>
        Pink and opaque, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are among the largest of the 85 known krill species. Their
        estimated numbers range from 125 million tons to 6 billion tons in the waters around Antarctica. During certain
        times of year, krill congregate in swarms so dense and widespread that they can be seen from space.
    </p>

    <p> Antarctic krill can live up to 10 years, an amazing longevity for such a heavily hunted creature. They spend
        their days avoiding predators in the cold depths of the Antarctic Ocean, some 320 feet below the surface. During
        the night, they drift up the water column toward the surface in search of phytoplankton.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alarmingly, there are recent studies that show Antarctic krill stocks may have dropped by 80 percent since the
        1970s. Scientists attribute these declines in part to ice cover loss caused by global warming. This ice loss
        removes a primary source of food for krill: ice-algae.
