    <h3>Where They Live</h3>

    <p>
        Blue whales are found in all oceans except the Arctic. They generally migrate seasonally between
        summer feeding grounds and winter breeding grounds, but some evidence suggests that individuals in
        certain areas might not migrate at all. Information about distribution and movement varies with
        location, and migratory routes are not well known. In general, distribution is driven largely by
        food availability—they occur in waters where krill are concentrated.

        In the North Atlantic Ocean, their range extends from the subtropics to the Greenland Sea.
        Blue
        whales have been sighted in the waters off eastern Canada and in the shelf waters of the eastern
        United States.
    </p>

    <p>
        Along the West Coast of the United States, eastern North Pacific blue whales are believed to spend winters off
        of Mexico and Central America. They likely feed during summer off the U.S. West Coast and, to a lesser extent,
        in the Gulf of Alaska and central North Pacific waters.

        Blue whales with young calves are regularly observed in the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez) from December
        through March. It is believed that this area is an important calving and nursing area for the species.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        In the northern Indian Ocean, there is a "resident" population. Blue whale sightings, strandings, and acoustic
        detections have been reported from the Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, and across the Bay of Bengal. The migratory
        movements of these whales are largely unknown, but may be driven by oceanographic changes associated with
        monsoons.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the Southern Hemisphere, Antarctic blue whales occur mainly in relatively high latitude waters south of the
        "Antarctic Convergence" and close to the ice edge in summer. They generally migrate to middle and low latitudes
        in winter, although not all whales migrate each year. Pygmy blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda)—a
        subspecies—are typically distributed north of the Antarctic Convergence and are most abundant in waters off
        Australia, Madagascar, and New Zealand. An unnamed subspecies of blue whale is found in the southeastern Pacific
        Ocean, particularly in the Chiloense Ecoregion, and migrates to lower latitude areas, including the Galapagos
        Islands and the eastern tropical Pacific.
    </p>


    <h3>Blue Whale Migration</h3>
    <p>
        Imagine an animal about the size of three school buses parked end-to-end, with a weight roughly equivalent to 40
        elephants, migrating south for the winter. This animal is the largest ever known to have lived on this
        planet—you would think that you would notice when it came through! However, despite their massive size and
        weight, blue whales and their travel patterns remain largely a mystery to scientists all over the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Much like <a href="https://www.neefusa.org/resource/animal-migration-activity-guide">some of their smaller
            counterparts in the animal kingdom</a>, blue whales migrate seasonally in search of
        food and possibly calving and nursing areas. They are found in all of the world’s oceans, and are thought to
        travel towards the poles in the spring to take advantage of the high <a
            href="https://www.whoi.edu/main/topic/jellyfish-zooplankton">zooplankton</a> production that occurs there in
        the summer (blue whales feed predominantly on krill, a type of zooplankton), and then back towards the equator
        in the early winter. While the search for breeding grounds is a common impetus for migration in many other
        animal species, scientists do not yet know when or where blue whales mate. Many females give birth in the warm
        waters of the southernmost leg of their journey, but research has not yet delivered a clear picture of the
        larger trends in blue whale reproduction.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        What information we do know about blue whales’ traveling habits does not apply to these animals world-over—while
        some populations only travel short distances to feed and reproduce, other blue whales will make annual trips
        from polar waters to equatorial waters. Without more information about where and when these whales are
        traveling, it can be difficult to keep these populations safe. Ship strikes can kill and seriously injure blue
        whales—three of these whales were killed by ship strike near the Santa Barbara Channel off the coast of <br>
        Southern
        California in 2007, a stark increase in mortality for animals with a typical life expectancy of 80 to 90 years
        in the wild.
    </p>

    <p>
        Want to know where to spot these whales? On the East Coast, blue whales are most commonly seen off the coast of
        eastern Canada, more specifically in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during the summer and fall feeding seasons. In the
        winter, this population group may be seen in the waters off of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and on rare occasions
        another population group may possibly be seen in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. On the West Coast, the
        Eastern North Pacific stock of blue whales is thought to winter I the waters off of Mexico and Central America,
        and feed during the summer in the waters off of the coast of the western United States. Other Pacific blue whale
        populations may be seen off of the Aleutians and in the Gulf of Alaska in the summer, and possibly Hawaii in the
        winter.
