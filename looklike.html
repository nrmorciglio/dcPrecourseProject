    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Blue whales are massive and – you guessed it! – blue (with a little gray mixed in). Their bodies are long and
        slender,
        and each whale has a unique marbling pattern of their skin, which scientists and observers can use to tell
        whales apart.
        When fully grown, blue whales can reach lengths of 70 to nearly 90 feet and weigh as much as 300,000 pounds.
        <br>
        They are
        rorqual whales, a group of large whale species known for their pleated, <br>
        expandable throat skin that assists them during feeding.

    <h3>Baleen</h3>
    <p>Inside of their mouths are plates of baleen, sheets of keratin that allow them to filter food out of
        sea water,
        and atop their heads are two blowholes used for breathing. Their dorsal fins are quite small for their body size
        and their
        pectoral flippers are long and thin. Sometimes, they will develop patchy algal growth on their backs due to
        their slow movements.

    <h3>Structural Adaptations</h3>

    <p>

        Blue whales bodies have been adapted in many ways to make them come to how they are today. It is believed that
        all whales closest land relatives are the hippopotamuses, so you can see that several changes would have had to
        happen to get a hippo to a whale.
    </p>
    <img class="looklikeimg" src="https://www.antarctica.gov.au/site/assets/files/45670/ia40342.1200x0.jpg"
        alt="Photograph of a Blue Whale swimming in blue water"> <br>

    <p>The body of the blue whale is streamlined which makes their movement through the water more efficient
        and they don’t have to use as much energy. Their front limbs have been changed and modified into flippers which
        help in steering and moving. <br>
        While their behind limbs have mostly disappeared and tails have broadened to form
        two large sections which contributor to their movement. <br>
        The tail moves powerfully up and down compared to a fish
        who's move side-to-side.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Storing Energy</h3>
    <p> Energy is stored in the thick, oily layer of blubber. The energy stored in blubber includes both proteins
        (mostly collagen) and fats (mostly lipids). The ability of blubber to use these stored nutrients means marine
        mammals are not forced to search for food for long periods of time. Nursing mothers, for instance, build up
        thick stores of blubber before giving birth. <br>
        In addition to feeding offspring, mothers cannot regularly search
        for food. <br>
        They rely on the energy stored in their blubber.
    </p>
    <h3>Blubber</h3>
    <p>
        Blubber is an important part of a marine mammal's anatomy. <br>
        It stores energy, insulates heat, and increases
        buoyancy.
    </p>

        alt="Diagram of whale blubber">

    <h2>Insulation</h2>
    <p>
        Blubber also insulates marine mammals, or helps keep them warm in icy waters. This insulation is necessary.
        Mammals are warm-blooded, meaning their body temperature stays about the same no matter what the temperature
        outside is. Keeping a warm body temperature in cold water requires more energy than keeping a warm body
        temperature in warm water. Some marine mammals, such as sea otters, have a thick fur coat, as well as blubber,
        to insulate them.
    </p>
    <p>
        To insulate the marine mammal, blood vessels in blubber constrict, or get smaller, in cold water. Constricted
        blood vessels reduce the flow of blood, thus <br>
        reducing the energy required to heat the body. This conserves heat.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Finally, blubber helps marine mammals stay buoyant, or float. Blubber is generally less dense than the ocean
        water surrounding it, so animals naturally float.
    </p>
    <p>
        Animals with the thickest blubber, such as right whales, are found in Arctic and Antarctic regions. In these
        animals, blubber is more than a foot thick! The thickness of their blubber does not indicate better energy
        storage, insulation, or buoyancy, however. Those characteristics are determined by the chemical property of the
        blubber.
        They have developed a thick layer of fat which is called blubber and is located under the skin. The blubber
        insulates the Blue Whale from the cold and provides buoyancy so they can stay afloat.
    </p>

    <img class="looklikeimg" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CaPE1mxUUAENfQs.jpg" alt="Blue Whale nostrils">
    <p>
        Their nostrils have moved to the top of their head which is now known as the blowhole and this allows them to
        come to the surface for air. <br>
        This blowhole normally reaches the surface before the rest of its body.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        When adapting to the water the Blue Whale internalised sensory and reproductive organs which reduced them
        dragging while swimming. <br>
        Blue Whales do not have ears on the outsides of their bodies (external) although they
        use air sinuses and bones to detect different sounds (internally).
